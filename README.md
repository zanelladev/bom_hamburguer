# Bom Hamburguer

Bom Hamburguer is a Flutter mobile application that simulates a restaurant ordering experience. Users can browse a product catalog, select items, and place orders with automatic discount calculation.  
The project follows Clean Architecture principles. Repositories in this project simulate API behavior using local in-memory data, allowing easy testing without backend integration.
